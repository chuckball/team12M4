## Introduction

This document provides an overview for our teamâ€™s project planning of a VR game that aims to educate 
users on proper etiquette and safety best practices of cycling and PMD usage in Singapore. Our product, 
also known as Edu-cycle, will enable the user to enter a simulated environment that mimics the real terrain in Singapore. 
Pairing with an external controller via Bluetooth, our product will task users to maneuver towards the in-game 
objective while practicing safe cycling/riding etiquette at the same time. Through a designer interface, authenticated 
SCTF admins can manipulate the game elements to change specific game settings as well. 
This product is not meant to be the only source of education for safe cycling/riding practices and is also not 
meant to be a substitute for learning how to ride a physical bicycle/PMD
